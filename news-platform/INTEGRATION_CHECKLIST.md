## ðŸŽ¯ **CRITICAL INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**

This document provides a complete checklist of what needs to be done to make the News Intelligence Platform fully functional and production-ready.

---

## ðŸ”´ **BLOCKING ISSUES (Must Be Resolved for Basic Functionality)**

### **1. Semantic Pattern Matching Integration** (CRITICAL)

**Current Status**: Placeholder implementation only
**Impact**: Stories won't be properly clustered without this
**Files to Modify**: `backend/services/story_clustering.py`

**Required Implementation:**
```python
class StoryClusteringEngine:
    async def cluster_articles(self, articles: List[NewsArticle]) -> List[StoryCluster]:
        # YOUR SEMANTIC ALGORITHMS MUST REPLACE THIS METHOD
        
        # Expected functionality:
        # 1. Analyze semantic similarity between articles
        # 2. Group articles about the same events
        # 3. Identify different perspectives on same story
        # 4. Return clusters with similarity scores
        
        # Current placeholder does basic keyword matching only
        pass
```

**Integration Requirements:**
- [ ] Replace `_placeholder_clustering()` method
- [ ] Implement semantic similarity scoring
- [ ] Add entity recognition and matching
- [ ] Handle perspective diversity measurement
- [ ] Test with real news data (100+ articles)
- [ ] Optimize for performance (process 500+ articles)
- [ ] Handle edge cases (single articles, duplicate content)

**Expected Input Format:**
```python
articles = [
    NewsArticle(
        title="Article title",
        content="Full article content...",
        source="BBC World News",
        published_at=datetime.utcnow(),
        source_perspective="center-international",
        url="https://...",
        category="international"
    )
]
```

**Expected Output Format:**
```python
clusters = [
    StoryCluster(
        cluster_id="unique_cluster_id", 
        main_event="Brief event description",
        articles=[article1, article2, ...],
        similarity_scores={...},
        source_diversity_score=0.75
    )
]
```

**Testing Requirements:**
- [ ] Unit tests with sample articles
- [ ] Integration tests with RSS feed data
- [ ] Performance tests with 500+ articles
- [ ] Accuracy validation against manual clustering

### **2. Impact Assessment Data Science Integration** (CRITICAL)

**Current Status**: Basic fallback scoring only
**Impact**: Stories won't be meaningfully ranked by importance
**Files to Modify**: `backend/services/impact_assessment.py`

**Integration Options:**

**Option A: HTTP Service Integration (Recommended)**
```python
# Configure your external service
await impact_engine.configure_external_service(
    endpoint="http://your-impact-service:8080/assess",
    auth_token="your_auth_token"
)
```

**Option B: Direct Python Integration**
```python
async def assess_article_impact(self, article: NewsArticle) -> float:
    # YOUR IMPACT ASSESSMENT ALGORITHM HERE
    features = your_feature_extractor.extract_features(article)
    impact_score = your_impact_model.predict(features)
    return float(impact_score)  # 0.0 - 10.0 scale
```

**Required Implementation:**
- [ ] Replace or enhance `assess_article_impact()` method
- [ ] Implement `assess_story_impact()` for complete clusters
- [ ] Add multi-factor impact scoring
- [ ] Include confidence scores and explanations
- [ ] Handle batch processing for efficiency

**Expected Input Format:**
```python
{
    "article": {
        "title": "Article title",
        "content": "Full article content",
        "source": "Source name",
        "published_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
        "source_perspective": "center-left",
        "category": "breaking",
        "url": "https://..."
    }
}
```

**Expected Output Format:**
```python
{
    "impact_score": 8.5,  # 0-10 scale
    "confidence": 0.92,   # 0-1 scale
    "factors": {
        "social_impact": 0.8,
        "political_significance": 0.9,
        "economic_impact": 0.6,
        "viral_probability": 0.7,
        "breaking_news_indicator": 0.95
    },
    "explanation": "High political significance due to..."
}
```

**Testing Requirements:**
- [ ] Unit tests with sample articles
- [ ] Validation against known high/low impact stories
- [ ] Performance tests with batch processing
- [ ] A/B testing against current scoring method

  - Test with real data from all 10 RSS sources
  - Verify report generation and file organization
  
- [ ] **Error Handling Test**
  - Network failures during feed polling
  - Malformed article content
  - Empty clustering results
  - Failed impact assessment
  
- [ ] **Performance Test**
  - Process 500+ articles (realistic daily volume)
  - Measure processing time (target: <30 minutes)
  - Monitor memory usage (target: <2GB)
  - Test concurrent processing capabilities

**Test Implementation:**
```python
# backend/tests/test_integration.py
async def test_full_processing_pipeline():
    # 1. Poll feeds
    articles = await feed_manager.poll_all_feeds()
    assert len(articles) > 50  # Minimum expected articles
    
    # 2. Cluster articles  
    clusters = await clustering_engine.cluster_articles(articles)
    assert len(clusters) > 5  # Should create multiple clusters
    
    # 3. Assess impact
    top_stories = await impact_engine.rank_stories_by_impact(clusters, 25)
    assert len(top_stories) == 25
    
    # 4. Generate reports
    for cluster in top_stories[:3]:  # Test first 3
        analysis = await dual_pipeline.analyze_story_cluster(cluster)
        report_files = await report_generator.generate_comprehensive_report(analysis, cluster)
